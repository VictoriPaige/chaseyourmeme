# Chase Your Meme

Welcome to Chase Your Meme!

Our system was designed for users to create and explore their own comedic endevors of the top trending memes. Chase Your Meme is powered by imgflip API call that returns a curated selection of the top 100 memes trending in the last 30 days on the internet. The system is designed for users to decide whether they want to pick their memes randomly by using our randomly selected meme generation page, or by filtering for their meme of choice using our search menu.

## MVP

Chase Your Meme was made to drive personal creativity by generating your own personal take on the hottest memes currently used. Users can generate a random image to use for the meme template and come up with their own spin for the caption, or they can use our database filled with 100 of the most popular memes.

## Post-MVP

In the near future, Chase Your Meme with be able to adapt to having a downloadable feature for users to be able to share their created work on other social media platforms. In the distant future, Chase Your Memes will be able to provide other forms of media such as gifs, reels, charts, posters, etc.

## Development Process

### API Used

Imgflip: https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes

### `npm start`
Getting Started with Create React App
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
